            <p>This is an example of face tracking using the javascript library <a href="https://github.com/auduno/clmtrackr"><em>clmtrackr</em></a>. The fitting method is generally called "Non-rigid/deformable face tracking/alignment using constrained local models".</p>
            <p>Note that this example works best in Google Chrome, with a computer that supports WebGL and floating point textures. It should however work in any modern browser.</p>
            <p>To try it out:
                <ol>
                    <li>allow the page to use your webcamera</li>
                    <li>make sure that your face is clearly visible in the video, and click start</li>
                    <li>see the model fitted to your face</li>
                    <ol>
            </p>
